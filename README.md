Student Management System (Java)

A console-based Student Management System built using Core Java, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and practical application of data structures. This project reflects my ability to design scalable, reliable, and modular solutions in Java.

Highlights

Demonstrates Java OOP concepts (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Collections)

Menu-driven program for easy user interaction

Core features: Add, Remove, Search, Display Students

Follows clean coding standards and best practices

Beginner-friendly yet scalable for advanced use

Why This Project?

This project is a foundation-level Java application that simulates real-world problem solving and showcases:

Logical thinking

Problem-solving with data structures

Hands-on Java development experience

It is an ideal demonstration of programming fundamentals and readiness for enterprise-level projects such as those at Cognizant.

Possible Extensions

To showcase further growth, I plan to add:

File-based or database storage (MySQL/MongoDB)

Student grading and report card generation

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing
